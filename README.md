# MIPS32_Processor
This repository shows the implementation of MIPS 32 Processor using RISC architecture. \
The code is written in Verilog. \
The IDE that i used was Visual Studio Code.\ 
It is strongly suggested to go through the "MIPS32_risc_architecture.pdf" and the following link to get better understanding.\
